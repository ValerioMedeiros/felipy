# Exercise 1 - Structured programming

In the Paint game, make the change follows:

1. Add a new color option.
1. Complete the function which draw the circle.
1. Complete the function which draw the retangle.
1. Complete the function which draw the triangle.
1. Add a *width* parameter which permit to change the width line. Make other
necessary adjustments.
1. After doing the draw functions, analyse them and check if there are duplicated
code. How the duplicated code can be cut out?

Note to teacher: this last exercise can be stand by, until the study of functions
as first class objects, because the implementation could be pass a function as
parameter. This will be seems a template method pattern, that will be recovery
in object oriented study.
